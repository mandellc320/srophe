                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="overView">General Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Criticism Archive is and for many years will remain a work in
                            progress, with new material being uploaded once or twice per year. At
                            present the focus is on published literary criticism by British women
                            writers of the “long” romantic period. Eventually, coverage can expand
                            both chronologically and nationally, with the aspiration to provide a
                            robust international archive of literary criticism by early women
                            writers. </p>
                        <h4>Editing Decisions</h4>
                        <p>Copytext of published material relies on accurately representing the text
                            as published. Few of the selections in this archive appeared in more
                            than one edition, but where multiple versions exist, the earliest
                            published version is emphasized, with aspirations to make later
                            revisions available when time and labor permits. Currently, editing
                            focuses on accessible teaching and research as well as coarse data
                            mining. Thus, both person identifications and annotations are brief,
                            while titles are simply encoded as such. </p>
                        <p>A few specific decisions are worth mentioning. Excepting a few basics
                            (full stop, comma, semi-colon, colon, and hyphen) punctuation and
                            characters outside those in the English language alphabet were encoded
                            as HTML entities. Quotation marks indicating block quotes, running
                            titles, compositor’s catchwords, and dashes within line breaks all have
                            been silently eliminated. Spelling has not been regularized except that
                            the long “s” has been silently modernized.</p>
                        <h4>Encoding Decisions</h4>
                        <p>Encoding conforms to TEI guidelines, allowing for representation of some
                            features of the original text while still enabling expedient publication
                            to extend text availability. Here you will find <a
