                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="overView">General Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Criticism Archive is and for many years will remain a work in
                            progress, with new material being uploaded once or twice per year. At
                            present the focus is on published literary criticism by British women
                            writers of the “long” romantic period. Eventually, coverage can expand
                            both chronologically and nationally, with the aspiration to provide a
                            robust international archive of literary criticism by early women
                            writers. </p>
                        <h4>Editing Decisions</h4>
                        <p>Copytext of published material relies on accurately representing the text
                            as published. Few of the selections in this archive appeared in more
                            than one edition, but where multiple versions exist, the earliest
                            published version is emphasized, with aspirations to make later
                            revisions available when time and labor permits. Currently, editing
                            focuses on accessible teaching and research as well as coarse data
                            mining. Thus, both person identifications and annotations are brief,
                            while titles are simply encoded as such. </p>
                        <p>A few specific decisions are worth mentioning. Excepting a few basics
                            (full stop, comma, semi-colon, colon, and hyphen) punctuation and
                            characters outside those in the English language alphabet were encoded
                            as HTML entities. Quotation marks indicating block quotes, running
                            titles, compositor’s catchwords, and dashes within line breaks all have
                            been silently eliminated. Spelling has not been regularized except that
                            the long “s” has been silently modernized.</p>
                        <h4>Encoding Decisions</h4>
                        <p>Encoding conforms to TEI guidelines, allowing for representation of some
                            features of the original text while still enabling expedient publication
                            to extend text availability. Here you will find <a

         <p class="pnoindent">In the decades since Anne K. Mellor published her landmark
            					essay "A Criticism of Their Own," literary criticism by
            					early women writers has drawn increasing interest.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> Among just a few of
            					the recent studies examining criticism by pre-twentieth-century British women,
            					Kimberly J. Stern has demonstrated that women critics negotiated the gender
            					ideologies of nineteenth-century critical networks to reimagine the professional
            					literary communities they sought to join.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> Megan

               						Inchbald</a>'s prefaces to <span class="italics">The
               							British Theatre</span> (1808) into study of <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</a>'s dramatic works.<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> My own work has promoted access to early British
            					women's criticism, considered its contributions to women writers'

            					works and others have contributed to our growing understanding of the extent
            and
            					significance of early criticism published by British women. </p>
         <p> As Peiser notes, however, particularly in the case of the periodical criticism
            					on which her essay depends, identification of and access to women's
            					literary criticism remains a challenge. Periodical criticism was often published
            					anonymously, and even when identification is possible, assembling a body of work
            					for teaching or research can be laborious at best. This archive collects
            					criticism published by women during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to
            					enrich study of their creative works, to challenge narrow assumptions about
            					where women's literary commentary appeared and the breadth of issues it
            					addressed, and to reveal the conscious authority of women writers' critical
            					voices. At the same time, in presenting women's views on literature and
            					aesthetics, this collection can encourage new perspectives on the nature,
            					purposes, and principles of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary
            					criticism, regardless of who may be the author. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">I. Aesthetic Innovations</p>
         <p> Study of criticism by women reveals that women critics could be in the vanguard
            					of debates over literary standards and aesthetics. For example, <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>'s 1800 preface
            					to <span class="italics">Lyrical Ballads</span> is considered a
            					landmark in early nineteenth-century literary theory for its explanation of the
            					premises behind a collection of poems that broke new ground in both form and
            					content. Yet in her "Introductory Discourse" to <span class="italics">Plays on the Passions</span> (1798), <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a> articulated several
            					of <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>'s most
            					innovative ideas while anticipating his treatise by two years. Convinced that
            					psychological states were more interesting than external events, <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</a> devoted her preface and
            					indeed her writing career to exploring how such powerful but shifting internal
            					effects could be conveyed in their full subtlety to a theater audience. Even
            					earlier, <a href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>
            					had voiced many of <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>'s views in similar language in her 1797 essay
            						"On Artificial Taste," published in the <span class="italics">Monthly Magazine</span>, where she
            					explores the relationship between immediate feeling and direct experience of
            					nature on one hand and "natural," affecting poetry on the other. It
            					diminishes none of these writers to recognize that all were concerned with
            					finding a smooth conduit between emotional experience and literary expression.
            					Rather, reading all three can enhance our appreciation of the relationship
            					between emotional authenticity, communication of feeling, and literary language,
            					one of the more significant aesthetic concerns of the early nineteenth century.
            						<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</a>'s essay, like
            						<a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>'s,
            					prefaced a collection of her own work—in this case, several plays—so
            					differing from familiar practices that she felt readers would need a framework
            					to appreciate them. And like <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>'s preface, <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</a>'s "Introductory Discourse"
            					develops a coherent theory for a literary form – in her case closet drama – that
            					comprises an important contribution to a major literary genre.<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> A milestone in literary criticism and theory, <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</a>'s is not the only
            					major essay penned by a woman to revise genre theory and history. Coming a
            					decade later, "On the Origin and Progress of
            					Novel-Writing," <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Anna Letitia
               						Barbauld</a>'s introductory essay to the fifty-volume collection <span class="italics">The British Novelists</span>, offered an
            					early contribution to genre classification and literary theory as well as a
            					prototypical canon of British fiction. <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s essay and her individual introductions to featured
            					novelists revised literary history in ways that gave unprecedented attention
            to
            					the contribution of women writers. At the same time, she argued that fictional
            					literature deserved more respect than most critics were willing to grant it.
            As
            					the introduction to the first definitive selection of complete text British
            					novels, the essay appeared in a context that had few rivals in either prestige
            					or appeal to national pride. </p>
         <p> When women's criticism enjoyed the prominence of <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s "Origin
            						and Progress of Novel-Writing," it was because of, not despite,
            					the critic's name. By the time <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s essay appeared, she had gained renown as a poet,
            					educator, children's author, political polemicist, literary biographer,
            					critic, and editor. The full title of the collection, boasting "with
            						an essay, and prefaces biographical and critical, by <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Mrs. Barbauld</a>,"
            					indicates the prestige and commercial appeal that the publishers hoped to gain
            					from <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s name. Much like
            						<a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>, <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Elizabeth Inchbald</a> was likewise
            					recruited to write criticism because of her celebrity, in her case as a popular
            					actress, playwright, and novelist, yet her criticism broke new ground as well.
            						<a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</a>'s prefaces to the
            					individual plays included in <span class="italics">The British
               							Theatre</span> (1806-8) turned away from established models of
            					Shakespeare criticism to emphasize staging and theatrical history, helping to
            					shift the direction of theater criticism for decades to come. Meanwhile,
            					although <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</a>'s essays
            					appeared first as individual installments, when brought together for the 1808
            					bound set, they offer, as did <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</a>'s "Introductory Discourse," a
            					coherent theory of closet drama. </p>
         <p> Like <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s
            						"Origin and Progress of Novel-Writing," <span class="italics">The British Theatre</span> bound set
            					appealed to the burgeoning sense of British national pride and the expanding
            					consumer market for the appurtenances of elegant sophistication, but it was
            					priced well out of reach of all but the most affluent middle- and upper-class
            					readers. But against the consumer-driven status of an attractively bound
            					matching set stands the other form in which <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</a>'s prefaces
            					appeared—brief essays, each introducing a single recently popular play,
            					published in inexpensive, weekly installments. Though lacking the grandeur of
            					the costly collection, this more ephemeral form of publication could reach a
            					wider, more diverse audience. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">II. Literary Reviewing</p>
         <p> While the prestige of prefatory essays to major collections is undeniable, no
            					criticism by Romantic-era British women writers reached as many readers and yet
            					has been as underrated as that in literary magazines, particularly literary
            					reviews. Especially toward the end of the eighteenth century, the number of
            					literary magazines and reviews increased dramatically while at the same time
            					women began to contribute to these new periodicals more frequently. As was
            					generally the practice in periodical criticism, most of these articles were
            					published unsigned. Consequently, although letters, diary entries, editors'
            					marked copies, and the like have led to some attributions of women's
            					periodical criticism, it is impossible to gauge how much can no longer be
            					identified. Yet the invisibility of this work belies its importance. James
            					Basker argues that literary journalism <span class="blockquote">introduced
               						new, more accessible forums for critical discussion; it multiplied and
               						diversified the opportunities for critical expression; it fostered new
               						critical values, drew attention to new literary genres, systematized the
               						treatment of established ones, and expanded the audience for criticism. […]
               						in subtler ways it affected canon formation, reception history, the
               						emergence of affective criticism, the assimilation of foreign influences,
               						the segregation of 'women's literature', and ultimately the
               						politics of culture.<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span></span> And if literary periodicals so dramatically influenced aesthetics,
            					culture, and critical practice, they had a similar impact on Romantic
            					writers' careers. Reviewing and similar literary commentary provided both
            					income and an avenue to public authority, and many women writers followed this
            					model of professionalism. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">A. Establishing Literary Authority in a Changing Print
            					Culture</p>
         <p> The earliest women literary critics usually came from the genteel classes. These
            					women had access to education and leisure to read and write. Moreover, until
            the
            					end of the eighteenth century, the nature of publishing explicitly emphasized
            					the amateur or dilettante, especially in the case of women. Most women writers,
            					critics included, emerged from the aristocratic milieu of coterie publication.
            					Access to publishers depended on these connections, in the form of either a
            					single prestigious patron or a subscription in which acquaintances and their
            					connections would underwrite the cost of publication. Within these networks,
            					writing entertained one's acquaintances and displayed one's talents.
            					Though publishing might bring much needed money to a writer patronized by the
            					more affluent members of the circle, the ostensible purpose of disseminating
            a
            					work was to expand the circle of edification and enjoyment. But as the
            					eighteenth century drew to a close, patronage forms of publication gave way to
            a
            					more modern, professional literary culture where contracts and direct
            					transactions between publisher and writer became paramount, where relationships
            					between writers and publishers were more direct and might include various types
            					of literary work, and where publishers might rely on writers' current
            					specializations and expect writers to cultivate new ones. While the numbers of
            					women publishing in all forms increased rapidly, the ever more commercialized
            					literary world came more firmly under control of the male dominated world of
            					large publishing houses and heavyweight literary magazines and reviews. Among
            					those women who best adapted to this masculine world of early professionalized
            					literary culture, authoring literary criticism often played a decisive role.
            </p>
         <p> The landscape of British women's literary history would present a very
            					different view if it were not for criticism's financial, intellectual, and
            					even emotional impact. Criticism brought poet <a href="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Elizabeth Moody</a>, for example, into
            					a circle of literary professionals that nudged her out of the amateur world of
            					coterie circulation into commercial publication of both her creative and her
            					critical work. For others such as <a href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, criticism provided the financial stability to
            					launch a literary career. Writing on demand for bookseller <a href="people.html#JohnsonJoseph">Joseph Johnson</a> and especially
            					reviewing for his new <span class="italics">Analytical
               						Review</span> allowed <a href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Wollstonecraft</a> to escape the lonely, taxing positions of governess
            					and companion and establish herself in London, where she joined the most vibrant
            					literary community in late eighteenth-century Britain. Further, for <a href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Wollstonecraft</a> and some other
            					young writers such as <a href="people.html#MartineauHarriet">Harriet
               						Martineau</a> and <a href="people.html#LandonLetitia">Letitia
               						Landon</a>, reading for a demanding schedule of reviewing provided
            					intellectual training, broadening and deepening their thinking and preparing
            					them for the creative or analytical work for which they are best known today.
            					And for <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>, criticism appears
            					to have sustained her financially while providing her, according to her niece
            					and first biographer, with an intellectual and emotional lifeline at the time
            of
            					her husband's mental collapse and eventual suicide.<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> When literary culture had been supported largely by patronage, authors knew much
            					of their audience, either personally or implicitly as connections of a patron
            or
            					acquaintance. Mostly from the genteel classes, these readers were often better
            					educated than the general run of English men and women, with taste that had been
            					formed on classical literature and more recent works modeled on the classical
            					tradition. But late in the eighteenth century, authors and critics began to
            					realize that the makeup of the reading population had changed, and that many
            new
            					readers lacked the education and hence the commonly agreed upon standards of
            					taste that the literary world had formerly counted on. In the minds of some,
            the
            					spread of reading and the variety of new types of publications undermined a
            					social order where the makeup of the reading public could be known and standards
            					of taste assumed to be shared. Many critics saw a need to generate broader
            					acceptance for the literary values they regarded as desirable and they began
            to
            					try to police the taste of these new readers, demonstrating that aesthetic
            					standards were far from self-evident, but were instead subject to lively debate.
            					Meanwhile, it was not merely authors and critics who experienced anxieties about
            					the new readers. Regarding familiarity with literature as a necessary mark of
            					gentility, the expanding middle class that comprised many of these new readers
            					turned to criticism, especially in periodicals, for guidance in developing their
            					literary taste.<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> Yet the popularity of scores of novels scorned in reviews
            					reveals a disquieting gap between the critic and an anonymous reading public
            					with inclinations that resisted critical discipline. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">B. Revising Aesthetic Standards</p>
         <p> If criticism failed to fully control public response to literary works,
            					aesthetic standards shifted as well. While the neoclassical standards that had
            					once held wide currency lost much favor by the end of the eighteenth century,
            					some of the ideals that were central at the beginning of the nineteenth century
            					have likewise declined in appeal since. Sentimentality, for example, was a hotly
            					debated topic, and in its more florid manifestations critics often objected that
            					it debased a literary work, making it suitable only for a sensation market. But
            					when modulated, emotional content enjoyed broad currency during much of the
            					later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many readers and writers believed
            					that emotional appeals offered a route for literature to help better society
            by
            					cultivating individual sensitivity and sympathy.<span class="sup"><a href="#11" id="back11"><sup>11</sup></a> </span>
            					Thus, sentiment and sensibility underlay much of the interest in moral effect
            					that was common to many critics, male and female, during the later years of the
            					eighteenth century. In fact, the demand for a positive moral tendency was in
            					itself a contested issue. Some critics followed <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Samuel Johnson</a> in suggesting that
            					literature should teach moral values by presenting only the highest examples
            					worthy of emulation. Yet others, such as <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>, explicitly argue that literature need not conform to such
            					restrictive standards, nor, indeed need it explicitly serve a higher social
            					purpose. <a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a> champions the
            					central significance of other qualities such as entertainment value, form,
            					versification, imagery, characterization, means of creating suspense, and
            					credibility or realism. </p>
         <p> Meanwhile, not only did shifting standards mean that few aesthetic ideals could
            					claim general acceptance, but in addition, many literary reviews had not yet
            					acknowledged aesthetic evaluation to be part of their task. During the first
            					half-century of the literary review, the imposition of the critic's own
            					opinion was often considered a corruption in the true purposes of a review. Many
            					critics presumed a highly educated and almost exclusively male audience, whom
            					they assumed to be capable of making their own judgments about literature. The
            					review's purpose was to present objective summary and extract to facilitate
            					those judgments. But by the end of the eighteenth century, literary reviews
            					found much of their readership among the expanding middle class, including
            					middle-class women. Many of these readers had only modest formal education, and
            					in reading about literature, they sought the kind of guidance provided in one
            					important predecessor for literary reviews—popular periodical papers along
            					the lines of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Joseph Addison</a>'s
            						<span class="italics">Spectator</span> and <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Samuel Johnson</a>'s <span class="italics">Rambler</span>. These forebears showcased
            					the merits of literary works, educating readers about literature and aesthetics
            					and helping form reader taste. </p>
         <p> If such high-minded aspirations informed part of the purpose of some criticism,
            					entertainment often played a vital role as well. Indeed, while many articles
            					aspired to objectivity, others strove for entertainment in the criticism itself.
            					Women critics might strive for entertainment by such means as structuring a
            					critical essay in the form of a dialog, as did <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Ann Radcliffe</a>, a strategy that
            					allowed for posing multiple critical perspectives while integrating some of the
            					diverting qualities of fiction and drama. In some cases, too, wit and irony
            					allowed a bridge between the older cultures of coterie circulation and modern
            					mass publication, as when <a href="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Elizabeth
               						Moody</a> masquerades as a male writer enjoying tobacco and port with his
            					reading. While <a href="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Moody</a>'s
            					urbane, satirical tone would have amused most readers, only the few who knew
            the
            					anonymous author to be a woman could have fully appreciated the humor. In other
            					instances, articles that repeat assessments that had already become commonplace,
            					such as <a href="people.html#JewsburyMaria">Maria Jane Jewsbury</a>'s
            					essay on <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Jane Austen</a>, suggest that
            					readers sometime cared as much for the pleasure of affirming comfortably
            					accepted ideas as for original and rigorous criticism. The fact that some of
            					these articles held the prestigious lead article positions confirms that this
            					purpose was accepted by publishers and readers alike. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">C. Further Insights</p>
         <p> Much remains to be uncovered in early literary criticism by women. A few
            					additional issues have already emerged, however, that are worth noting. For one,
            					women critics often used commentary on literature to participate in wide-ranging
            					debates on topics of public concern. While talking about literature, women
            					comment on public events or call attention to the ways literature affects public
            					issues. Their comments on British character or the British literary heritage,
            					for example, demonstrate that they understood national identity and character
            as
            					historically and culturally determined. When women critics speak of
            					literature's influence on individual virtue, for instance, they frequently
            					do so in terms of the ways literature shapes national character. Moreover, women
            					critics show strong interest in women writers. Not only do women critics
            					frequently praise other women writers, but they sometimes capitalize on the
            					occasion of reviewing one female writer to promote other women writers, as when
            						<a href="people.html#JewsburyMaria">Jewsbury</a> endorses <a href="people.html#SoutheyCaroline">Caroline Bowles</a> while writing on
            						<a href="people.html#AustenJane">Jane Austen</a>. Yet women critics
            					often hold their female contemporaries to exacting standards, refusing to follow
            					the example of feigned tolerance that provided a thin veneer for their male
            					contemporaries' clubby assurance of feminine literary inferiority. Where
            					women critics include patronizing expressions like "the fair author,"
            					close reading of the discussion often reveals elements of parody or humor. </p>
         <p class="pnoindent">III. Conclusion</p>
         <p> There is much to be gained, then, from incorporating early women's literary
            					criticism into our study of our literary past. The aspiration in creating this
            					archive is to make this criticism more accessible, encouraging teaching,
            					research, and enjoyment of this rich resource. It is to be hoped that doing so
            					will give rise to new research, new questions, and new insights about not
            					only early women's criticism, but early women writers and literary history
            					as a whole. </p>
