                <h2>Introduction to the Poetess Archive</h2>
                <p> This archive constitutes a resource for studying the literary history of popular British and American poetry. 
                    Much of it composed during what can be called the "bull market" of poetry's popularity(<a href="about.html#note1" style="color:white;">1</a>)
                    <a name="back1" id="back1"/>,  late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century popular poetry was often written in what came to 
                    be designated an "effeminate" style, whether written by men or women. Writings in the poetess tradition were 
                    disseminated in myriad collections: miscellanies, beauties, literary annuals, gift books. They achieved a place of 
                    prominence in virtually every middle-class household. The Poetess Archive Database now contains a bibliography of over 
                    4,000 entries for works by and about writers working in and against the "poetess tradition," the 
                    extraordinarily popular, but much criticized, flowery poetry written in Britain and America between 1750 and 1900. </p>
